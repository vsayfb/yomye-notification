# GitHub environment tools

Run `configure-gh-staging.sh` for AWS Lambda staging or
`configure-gh-production.sh` for GCP Cloud Run production after applying the
matching Terraform root. Set `GH_REPO=owner/repository` to override repository
detection; an alternate Terraform root may be passed as the first argument.
OIDC is used, so no static cloud credential secret is stored in GitHub.
